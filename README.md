# docGen
This repo consist of scripts that can be added to the Xcode project build phases to generate Apple like Documentation. Please note these script are bare minimum. They uses Jazzy for swift from Realm and appledoc for objective C from tomaz. these script can be added as submodule so that you can get the latest pull. At least thats idea when I wanted to strip them out of my projects and add here as open source project.
